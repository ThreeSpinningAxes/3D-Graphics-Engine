# 3D-Graphics-Engine

A basic 3D graphics engine I made entirely from scratch without using any graphics library like OpenGL. The engine as of right now can perform live transformations
on meshes (loaded from obj files) which include rotation, scaaling, and translation. The Phong lighting model is also implemented to handle lighting and shading. A work
in progress..
